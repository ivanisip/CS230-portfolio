# CS230 Portfolio - The Gaming Room Software Design Document

## Overview
This repository contains the software design document I created for The Gaming Room as part of the CS230 course at SNHU. This project demonstrates my ability to effectively design software applications, communicate the design to clients and development teams, and incorporate critical principles of cloud-based software development.

## The Gaming Room Client and Software Requirements

**Client:** The Gaming Room  
**Project:** The client required a scalable, multi-platform trivia game that could support multiple players and be adaptable for future enhancements. The design needed to ensure a smooth user experience across various platforms while maintaining flexibility and scalability.

## Highlights of the Documentation
- **Thorough Architecture Design:** I ensured the architecture was well-defined and modular, allowing for easy maintenance and future scalability.
- **Focus on Serverless Architecture:** I emphasized a serverless approach to reduce infrastructure management overhead and improve cost efficiency, allowing the development team to concentrate on application logic.
- **Clear Communication:** The document was structured to communicate the design to technical and non-technical stakeholders.

## Reflection on the Design Process
- **Helpful Aspects:** Working through the design document allowed me to identify potential challenges early in the process, which made the coding phase smoother and more efficient.
- **Areas for Improvement:** If I could revise one part of the document, I would enhance the user interface section by including more detailed wireframes and user flow diagrams to better illustrate the user experience.
- **Understanding User Needs:** I prioritized user needs by designing an intuitive interface that ensures easy navigation and seamless gameplay. Addressing user needs is essential to creating a successful application that meets client expectations.

## Approach to Software Design
- Using a microservices architecture, I approached the design by breaking down the application into smaller, manageable modules. This approach allows for independent scaling, more accessible updates, and better fault tolerance.
- I plan to continue using this modular approach in future projects while incorporating more user-centered design techniques.
